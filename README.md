# README
This colab code takes the MillionSongSubset from the MillionSongDataset and attempts to predict how popular a song is using classification on the song_hotttnesss attribute using the other attributes in the dataset

When running load_mss_dataframe() with large max file amounts, code may get stuck on a corrupted/unreadable file, manually interrupting the run process should skip the current file.
